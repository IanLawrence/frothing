Liferea is an abbreviation for Linux Feed Reader. It is a news
aggregator for online news feeds. It supports a number of different
feed formats including RSS/RDF, CDF and Atom. There are many other
news readers available, but these others are not available for
Linux or require many extra libraries to be installed. Liferea
tries to fill this gap by creating a fast, easy to use, easy to
install news aggregator for GTK/GNOME.

This documentation was last updated for Liferea version 1.4.

Installation
============

To install Liferea you can either get a package for your 
Linux distribution or try to compile and install Liferea
from the Source Tarball. In the following you will find
short hints for several platforms. See below to find
how to compile the tarball.

Ubuntu/		There are official packages in both Debian and Ubuntu
Debian:		
		To install Liferea run:

		   apt-get install liferea

RedHat/		For FC 3 and 4 you can install Liferea from the 
Fedora:		Extras repositories. Just run:

		   yum install liferea

		Dag Wieers provides packages for both Fedora which
		can be found at http://dag.wieers.com/packages/liferea/.
		
SuSE:		Since SuSE 10.1 there are official Liferea package.
		Older packages can be found at:
		
		http://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/suser-guru/rpm/packages/Network/liferea/

Gentoo:		There is an ebuild available at:

		http://www.breakmygentoo.net/ebuilds/

FreeBSD:	There are Liferea packages (built by Hye-Shik Chang) at
		
		http://www.freshports.org/net/liferea/

Fink		The Fink project also supports Liferea:

		http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/package.php/liferea
		
Solaris		Since 0.9.2 there are Solaris packages built
                be Jeremy Teo. This package was built to work 
                with the Solaris gtk2,libxml2,gconf2 and 
                libgtkhtml packages from blastwave.org.

Browser Integration
===================

Liferea allows direct subscriptions from Firefox 1.5+
and Epiphany. Epiphany provides a standard plugin that
allows adding subscription directly to Liferea.

If you want to subscribe from within Firefox 1.5 you need
to install an extension manually. Although there are
several extensions that might do the task one called
"FeedBag" is supplied with the source tarball. To
install it open feedbag.xpi from the source root
directory with Firefox. This should start the 
installation procedure. Once installed clicking the
live bookmark icon should add subscriptions to Liferea.

If you want to subscribe from within Firefox 2.0 you don't
need to install the "FeedBag" extension. Instead you can
configure Firefox 2.0 to add subscriptions to Liferea
directly. To do so click the feed icon in the location 
entry. Firefox will then present a menu where you can 
configure a manual command instead of the Live Bookmarks
to add subscriptions. Liferea supplies a script named
"liferea-add-feed" that you can tell Firefox to use.
	

Compiling from Source
=====================
		
If you want you can compile Liferea. Download the tarball from 
the SourcForge project page and extract with: 

   tar zxvf liferea-1.4.0.tar.gz 

Of course you should adjust the filename. After unpacking 
run the standard autotools commands: 

   ./configure
   make
   make install		


Compiling from SVN
==================

To anonymously check out a source copy execute this:

   svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/liferea/trunk .

More information about using SVN with Liferea can be
found at http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=87005

After checking out a source copy you need to prepare the
compile environment. Executing the following commands should
do the trick:

   autoreconf -i
   intltoolize

If everything went well you can continue with "configure"
as described in the previous section.


Dependencies
============

The library dependencies for Liferea are: gtk2, gconf2, libxml2,
libxslt, sqlite3 and either libgtkembedmoz, libxul or gtkhtml2.

If you want to use the Mozilla browser module you need a Mozilla,
Firefox or XulRunner installation containing libgtkembedmoz.so.
